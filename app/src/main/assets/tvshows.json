The first season introduces the main character, Meredith Grey, as she enrolls in Seattle Grace Hospital's internship program and faces unexpected challenges and surprises. Season one had nine series regulars, six of whom have been part of the main cast ever since. The season initially served as a mid-season replacement for the legal drama Boston Legal, airing in the Sunday night time slot at 10:00, after Desperate Housewives. Although no clip shows have been produced for this season, the events that occur are recapped in \"Straight to Heart\", a clip-show which aired one week before the winter holiday hiatus of the second season ended. The season was officially released on DVD as two-disc Region 1 box set under the title of Grey's Anatomy: Season One on February 14, 2006 by Buena Vista Home Entertainment.\n\nThe season's reviews and critiques were generally positive, and the series received several awards and nominations for the cast and crew. The first five episodes of the second season were conceived, written and shot to air as the final five episodes of the first season, but aired during the 2005-2006 season due to the high number of viewers that watched \"Who's Zoomin' Who?\", the season's highest-rated episode with 22.22 million viewers tuning in.",

Tony DiNozzo nearly died of the pneumonic plague in \"SWAK\" while the season finale, \"Twilight\", ended with a shocking and unexpected twist: Caitlin Todd was shot and killed by Ari Haswari.\n\nThis is also the second and final DVD to feature Sasha Alexander who plays Caitlin Todd on the cover. Alexander left the show for good after her character, Todd was killed in the Season 2 finale.\n\nIn addition, this is the first DVD cover that Sean Murray who plays Timothy McGee appears on, having become a permanent member of Gibbs' team at the end of the Season 2 opening episode, \"See No Evil\" which also saw Murray being added to the opening credits as well.

Also, albeit later in the season, Army CID Lieutenant Colonel Hollis Mann is introduced as another love interest for Gibbs.\n\nIn December 2006, Bill Keveney from USA Today announced that the \"CBS investigative drama NCIS topped the Nielsen viewership list for the first time with 17.4 million. CBS was the No. 1 network in viewers and young adults for the week of Dec. 11-17.\"\n\nTV Guide reported on May 5, 2007 that creator and showrunner Donald Bellisario would step down and leave the series due to a disagreement with series star Mark Harmon. Because of Bellisario's \"chaotic management style\", Harmon threatened to leave NCIS. Co-executive producer Chas. Floyd Johnson and headwriter Shane Brennan replaced Bellisario as showrunner.",

The fifth season also reveals more background information about Gibbs' past before NCIS.\n\nThe Writers Guild strike limited episode production and the DVD set had five discs instead of six. The season ended with its 19th episode on May 20, 2008; the strike-caused gap is between episodes 11 and 12. The season ended with a two-part season finale called \"Judgment Day\".

In the closing seconds of the sixth season, Ziva was shown to have been captured and tortured for information about NCIS.\n\nIn the first episode of season 7, Ziva was rescued by Gibbs, Tony and McGee and upon her return to Washington, she eventually became an NCIS agent after resigning from Mossad for good. Much of the season's story arc then focused on the Mexican Drug War and Colonel Merton Bell, a suspected murderer who hired the lawyer M. Allison Hart to represent him. Hart quickly became a thorn in Gibbs' side by regularly showing up and protecting possible suspects while they were being investigated, claiming that they were her clients.\n\nThe season drew to a close as Gibbs was later kidnapped by someone working for Paloma Reynosa, the daughter of the late Pedro Hernandez, a drug dealer Gibbs himself shot dead twenty years previously as Hernandez had been responsible for killing Gibbs' first wife Shannon and daughter Kelly. While being held prisoner, Paloma informed Gibbs that he would work for her or she would have everyone he ever knew and cared about die if he didn't go through with her demands.",

Notable events included the terrorism and internal affairs threat during the Enemies two-parter, and the arrival of another Major Case Response Team from Rota, Spain, the team that Tony was offered to be lead of in the beginning of season 4.

Season nine introduced several new recurring guest stars, most notably Dr. Samantha Ryan, a love interest for Gibbs.\n\nBy the end of the season, NCIS and the Navy had found themselves under threat from a new and dangerous enemy: insurance CEO-turned terrorist, Harper Dearing, who lost his son in a fire aboard a Navy ship and is out for revenge against the Navy for not solving the problem that led to the fire and then not updating ships with the same problem. He also has a grudge against NCIS, as his son wouldn't have been on the ship if they had not transferred him.\n\nManaging to get a hold of powerful explosives, Dearing started firebombing Navy ships. However, towards the end of the season, Dearing stepped up his game: he had Director Vance abducted. Whilst NCIS found him quickly, it transpired that Dearing was only after Vance for his car, managing to rig up explosives in the car seat so that Vance would unknowingly deliver a car bomb to the Navy Yard. By the time Gibbs realized, it was nearly too late; the bomb detonated, resulting in major damage to the NCIS building, as well as many deaths and injuries and leaving the fates of Gibbs, Tony, McGee, Abby, Ziva and Vance unknown. Upon learning of the destruction, Ducky suffered a heart attack on the beaches of Miami. The finale aired on May 15, 2012.",

The season premiere was seen by 20.48 million viewers, focusing on the aftermath of the bombing of the Navy Yard from the ninth-season finale and culminating with the apprehension of Harper Dearing, who is killed when he attempts to resist arrest.\n\nThe season continues with mostly standalone episodes until the \"Shabbat Shalom\" and \"Shiva\" story arc, which focuses on the deaths of Eli David and Jackie Vance and sets the rest of the season into motion. Leon Vance and Ziva David soon discover that Mossad Deputy Director Ilan Bodnar was behind the attack, and set out for revenge. They track Bodnar to Berlin, but later learn that he had never left the United States. Going against orders from the Department of Homeland Security, Ziva finds Bodnar on a ship headed for South Africa and kills him. This sparks a massive investigation by the Department of Defense, headed by Richard Parsons. His sneaky and unprofessional methods cause the team to question his true intentions. Everyone soon realizes that he is not interested in Ziva or Vance, but has instead set his sights on Gibbs. Parsons pressures Gibbs to admit that he and his team have broken the law on countless occasions and to come forward and admit everything that he has done. After a long feud, Gibbs is freed of his charges and sent on a top-priority mission, while Ziva, DiNozzo, and McGee resign from the agency. The season ends with a cut to four months later, showing Gibbs aiming a sniper rifle at FBI agent Tobias Fornell. The season finale aired on May 14, 2013.",

The producers convinced Fox to move the debut to December 17, and aired \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\" as the first episode of the series.
